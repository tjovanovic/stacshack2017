# Auto DJ

## Inspiration
Partying.

## What it does
When you tell Alexa a line from song lyrics it can:
* Get Alexa to *sing the following lyrics*.
* Tell you its *artist name and song title*.
* Play its *Youtube video*.

## How we built it
* We used **Python**.
* Interaction using **Amazon Alexa** through flask-ask.
* Songs titles from **Last.fm** Top Tracks API.
* Lyrics from **LyricsWiki**.
* Lyrics processing using **NLTK**.
* Songs searched using **Youtube** API.

## Challenges we ran into
Tune lyrics to feed into Alexa.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works and is actually quite cheeky.

## What we learned
We got to learn all those new APIs.

## What's next for Auto DJ
Sleep.
