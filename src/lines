The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van in the man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, dont mind me
Say boy, let’s not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come, come on now follow my lead
Im in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
Im in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Well Im in love with your body
(Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I)
One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And Im singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
I’m in love with the shape of you
Come on be my baby, come on
(Come on be my baby, come on)
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I dont think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I dont know if its fair but I thought How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While Im wasted with someone else
If we go down then we go down together
Theyll say you could do anything
Theyll say that I was clever
Well get away with everything
Lets show them we are better
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin in
Lets show them we are
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
If we go down
Im tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out of your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I dont see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what youve done
Im a motherfuckin starboy
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin hefty, ah
Coming for the king, thats a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I dont really listen
Im in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talking bout me, I don’t see the shade
I’m a motherfuckin starboy
Im a motherfuckin’ starboy
Let a nigga Brad Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wrath of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash, get me close to God
We dont pray for love, we just pray for cars
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I’ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I’ve grown
But I can’t wait to go home
I’m on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it’s real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don’t reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we’d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we’ve grown
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One’s brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can’t wait to go home
And I’m on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it’s real
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white-picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, were living in a bubble, a bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble
Arent you lonely
Up there in utopia?
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
(Aha) So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, its your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumblin around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think were free
Drink, this ones on me
Were all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
(Aha) So put (So put) your rose-colored glasses on
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And were about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)
It goes on, and on, and on
(It goes) (Turn it up) It goes on, and on, and on (It goes on and on and on and on)
It goes on, and on, and on (on and on and on and on)
Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We dont ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
Youve been scared of love and what it did to you
You dont have to run, I know what youve been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We dont have to rush when youre alone with me
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time
Im just trying to get you high
And faded off this touch
You dont need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want
Youve been scared of love
And what it did to you
You dont have to run
I know what youve been through
Just a simple touch
And it can set you free
We dont have to rush
When youre alone with me
I know what you feel right now
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming, babe
I dont blame you
We got carried away
I cant hold on
To an empty space
Now youve found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think youre too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to?
Youve got the body, youve got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
My young heart
Chose to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson
The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring into space
I see a different view
Where do you dare me to, dare me to
When and where did we all go cold?
Call it love and devotion
Call it the moms adoration
Foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single mums out there going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
She works the night, by the water
Shes gonna stress, so far away
From her fathers daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
Shes got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him uh, love, no ones ever gonna hurt you, love
Im gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
She tells him your life aint gonna be nothing like my life
Youre gonna grow and have a good life
Im gonna do what Ive got to do
So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye
Im gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, dont you cry
Somebodys got you
Rockabye baby, Rockabye
Rockabye, no
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, oh oh yeah
Single mama you doing out there
Facing the hard life, without no fear
Just so you know that you really care
Cause any obstacle come youre well prepared
And no mama, you never set tear
Cause you have to set things year and to year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find his school fee and the bus fare
Mmm Marie, the paps disappear
In the round back cant find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
You know say you nuh stop the time fi a jear
Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He dont know hes safe
When she says uh, love, no ones ever gonna hurt you, love
Bidda-bang-bang-bang, alright then
He dont know hes safe when she says
(Before it slips away)
Say something loving
I just dont remember
The thrill of affection
I need a reminder
The feelings escaped me
I went looking for it
Could have been anyones kiss
Throwing my arms at no-one
When I gave up I found love
The thought flows through my mind
And its growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous
You say something loving
Its so overwhelming
Feels so unfamiliar
Without hesitation
It hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave
Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I was impatient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?
I dont know, I dont know
What this is but it doesnt feel wrong
Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?
I say something loving
I cant hold it inside
Is only getting stronger
All my hesitations
Are fading, fading
I feel it taking over
Dont let it slip away
