we dont pray for love we just pray for cars
when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as i rolled down
i was younger then take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here made friends and lost them through the years
and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long i know ive grown
but i cant wait to go home
im on my way driving at ninety down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer and i miss the way you make me feel and its real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night i dont reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then take me back to when we found
weekend jobs when we got paid wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how weve grown
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
ones brother overdosed
ones already on his second wife
ones just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i cant wait to go home
and im on my way i still remember these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers and i miss the way you make me feel and its real
are we crazy
living our lives through a lens
trapped in our whitepicket fence
like ornaments
so comfortable were living in a bubble a bubble
so comfortable we cannot see the trouble the trouble
arent you lonely
up there in utopia
where nothing will ever be enough
happily numb
aha so put your rosecolored glasses on
and party on
turn it up its your favorite song
dance dance dance to the distortion
turn it up keep it on repeat
stumblin around like a wasted zombie
yeah we think were free
drink this ones on me
were all chained to the rhythm
to the rhythm
are we tone deaf
keep sweeping it under the mat
thought we could do better than that
i hope we can
aha so put so put your rosecolored glasses on
stumbling around like a wasted zombie
it is my desire
break down the walls to connect inspire
ay up in your high place liars
time is ticking for the empire
the truth they feed is feeble
as so many times before
they greed over the people
they stumbling and fumbling
and were about to riot
they woke up they woke up the lions
woo
it goes on and on and on
it goes turn it up it goes on and on and on it goes on and on and on and on
it goes on and on and on on and on and on and on
tell me what you really like
baby i can take my time
we dont ever have to fight
just take it stepbystep
i can see it in your eyes
cause they never tell me lies
i can feel that body shake
and the heat between your legs
youve been scared of love and what it did to you
you dont have to run i know what youve been through
just a simple touch and it can set you free
we dont have to rush when youre alone with me

throwing my arms at noone
when i gave up i found love
the thought flows through my mind
and its growing all the time
i do myself a disservice
to feel this weak to be this nervous

its so overwhelming
feels so unfamiliar
without hesitation
it hits me hits me
it feels so unfamiliar
your touch stays on my skin
i feel it start sinking in
here come my insecurities
i almost expect you to leave
were you really looking for me
try your best to reassure me
i was impatient to meet you

i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest
i knew i loved you then
but youd never know
cause i played it cool when i was scared of letting go
i know i needed you
but i never showed
but i wanna stay with you

with a kiss on your head
and ill take the kids to school

and ill thank my lucky stars for that night

i wanna dance with you right now oh
and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that everyday youll get better
you make me feel this way somehow
im so in love with you
and i hope you know
darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold

and i wanna stay with you
i wanna live with you
even when were ghosts
cause you were always there for me
when i needed you most
im gonna love you till
my lungs give out
i promise till death we part
like in our vows
so i wrote this song for you
now everybody knows
that its just you and me
first things first
ima say all the words inside my head
im fired up and tired of the way that things have been ohooh
the way that things have been ohooh
second thing second
dont you tell me what you think that i can be
im the one at the sail im the master of my sea ohooh
the master of my sea ohooh
i was broken from a young age
taking my sulking to the masses
write down my poems for the few
that looked at me took to me shook to me feeling me
singing from heart ache from the pain
take up my message from the veins
speaking my lesson from the brain
seeing the beauty through the
pain
you made me a you made me a believer believer
you break me down you build me up believer believer
i let the bullets fly oh let them rain
my life my love my drive it came from
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate that youve heard has turned your spirit to a dove ohooh
your spirit up above ohooh
i was choking in the crowd
living my brain up in the cloud
falling like ashes to the ground
hoping my feelings they would drown
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited
till it broke open and it rained down
it rained down like
you break me down you built me up believer believer
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flames
youre the face of the future the blood in my veins ohooh
the blood in my veins ohooh
my life my love my drive if came from
have you got colour in your cheeks
do you ever get that fear that you cant shift
the type that sticks around like summat in your teeth
are there some aces up your sleeve
have you no idea that youre in deep
i dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep
cause theres this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee
do i wanna know
if this feeling flows both ways
sad to see you go
was sort of hoping that youd stay
baby we both know
that the nights were mainly made for saying things that you cant say tomorrow day
crawlin back to you
ever thought of calling when youve had a few
cause i always do
maybe im too
busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now ive thought it through
so have you got the guts
been wondering if your hearts still open
and if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
im sorry to interrupt
its just im constantly on the cusp
of trying to kiss you
but i dont know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to
maybe im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
too busy being yours to fall
ever thought of calling darling
verse 1 zayn
been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping youd call
its just a cruel existence like theres no point hoping at all
prechorus 1 zayn
baby baby i feel crazy
up all night all night and every day
give me something oh but you say nothing
what is happening to me
chorus zayn
i dont wanna live forever cause i know ill be living in vain
and i dont wanna fit wherever

doesnt mean our brains will change from hand grenades
youll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
youll never know the murderer sitting next to you
youll think howd i get here sitting next to you
but after all ive said please dont forget
we dont deal with outsiders very well
they say newcomers have a certain smell
you have trust issues not to mention
they say they can smell your intentions
youll never know the freakshow sitting next to you
youll have some weird people sitting next to you
watch it
whyd you come you knew you should have stayed
i tried to warn you just to stay away
and now theyre outside ready to bust
look at you kids with your vintage music

signals crossing can get confusing
its enough just to make you feel crazy crazy crazy
sometimes its enough just to make you feel crazy
you get ready you get all dressed up
to go nowhere in particular
back to work or the coffee shop
doesnt matter cause its enough
to be young and in love ah ah
look at you kids you know youre the coolest
the world is yours and you cant refuse it
seen so much you could get the blues
but that dont mean that you should abuse it
though its enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy
i know its enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy
but you get ready you get all dressed up
it dont matter because its enough
hmm ah ah
hmm
dont worry baby
and its enough just to make me go crazy crazy crazy

and i can leave you just as fast
but you dont judge me
cause if you did baby i would judge you too

ive got so cautious
and now i trip on every move i make
let one play
to be that careless
with every kiss from a friend
with everything i pretend not to feel
am i too high am i too proud
is the music too loud
for me to hear
now i go out
but every beat is a violent noise
dries my eye
with every beat comes a violent noise
the melody sung
and i dont know the voice
youve been staying out late
trying your best to escape
i hope you find what youre looking for
let a moment take place
without running away
i hope you silence the noise
how could eyes this wide
lose sight of a world outside
ive looked away cowardice
oh hey
i dont wanna know know know know
whos taking you home home home home
and loving you so so so so
the way i used to love you no
the way i used to love you oh

and every time i go out yeah
i hear it from this one i hear it from that one

how did it end up like this
it was only a kiss
now im falling asleep
and shes calling a cab
while hes havin a smoke
and shes takin a drag
now theyre going to bed
and my stomach is sick
and its all in my head but shes touching his chest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go
and i just cant look
its killing me
and taking control
jealousy
turning saints into the sea
swimming through sick lullabies
choking on your alibis
but its just the price i pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eager eyes
cause im mr brightside
im comin out of my cage
cause i just cant look
i never
seem right seem wrong
only difference is that im that one
second time a wrap
feels like this songs already been sung
mirroring situations like youre an imitation
do i watch and repeat
and as if i tried to i turned out just like you
do we watch and repeat
they all say i will become a replica
your mistakes were only chemical
25 and youre just like me
is it in my nature to be stuck on repeat
another encore to an aftershow
do i chase the night or does the night chase me
load up on guns bring your friends
its fun to lose and to pretend
shes overbored and selfassured
oh no i know a dirty word
hello hello hello hello
hello hello hello how low
hello hello how low how low
hello hello hello
with the lights out its less dangerous
here we are now entertain us
i feel stupid and contagious
a mulatto an albino
a mosquito my libido

im worse at what i do best
and for this gift i feel blessed
our little group has always been
and always will until the end
and i forget just why i taste
oh yeah i guess it makes me smile
i found it hard was hard to find
oh well whatever never mind
a denial a denial
someone said they left together
i ran out the door to get her
she was holding hands with trevor
not the greatest feeling ever
said pull yourself together
you should try your luck with heather
then i heard they slept together
oh the less i know the better
the less i know the better
oh my love cant you see yourself by my side
no surprise when youre on his shoulder like every night
oh my love cant you see that youre on my mind
dont suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
so goodbye
she said its not now or never
wait 10 years well be together
i said better late than never
just dont make me wait forever
dont make me wait forever
i dont suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
i was doing fine without you
til i saw your face now i cant erase
giving in to all his bullshit
is this what you want is this who you are
til i saw your eyes turn away from mine
oh sweet darling where he wants you
said come on superman say your stupid line
i used to believe
we were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
somethin beautiful
sellin a dream
smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
on a miracle
say go through the darkest of days
heavens a heartbreak away
never let you go never let me down
oh its been a hell of a ride
driving the edge of a knife
dont you give up
i wont give up
let me love you
oh baby baby
dont fall asleep
at the wheel weve got a million miles ahead of us
miles ahead of us
all that we need
is a rude awakening to know were good enough
know were good enough
im gonna fight em off
a seven nation army couldnt hold me back
theyre gonna rip it off
taking their time right behind my back
and im talking to myself at night
because i cant forget
back and forth through my mind
behind a cigarette
and a message coming from my eyes
says leave it alone
dont want to hear about it
every single ones got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it coming back my way
im gonna sell it to you
and that aint what you want to hear
but thats what ill do
and the feeling coming from my bones
says find a home
im going to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
im gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and im bleeding and im bleeding and im bleeding
right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me
and i will think no more
and the stains coming from my blood
youre giving me a million reasons to let you go
youre giving me a million reasons to quit the show
youre givin me a million reasons

about a million reasons
if i had a highway i would run for the hills
if you could find a dry way id forever be still
but youre giving me a million reasons

i try to make the worst seem better
lord show me the way
to cut through all his worn out leather
ive got a hundred million reasons to walk away
but baby i just need one good one to stay

and the crowds dont remember my name
when my hands dont play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
cause honey your soul can never grow old
its evergreen
and baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
maybe its all part of a plan
ill just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that youll understand
but baby now

oh maybe we found love right where we are
when you were here before
couldnt look you in the eye

youre so fuckin special
but im a creep

burn the witch
we know where you live
red crosses on wooden doors
and if you float you burn
loose talk around tables
abandon all reason
avoid all eye contact
do not react
shoot the messengers

in the wake of a hurricane
dark skin of a summer shade
nose dive in the flood lines
tall tower of milk crates
cannonball off the porch side
older kids trying off the roof
just the same way you showed me you showed
if you could die and come back to life
up for air from the swimming pool
youd kneel down to the dry land
kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined
thats the same way you showed me showed me
